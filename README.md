# Introduction to tractometry data analysis
This notebook assumes proficiency in python, numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn. We recommend looking up tutorials for these tools if you are unfamiliar with any of them, such as [Neuroimaging and Data Science](https://neuroimaging-data-science.org/root.html).
Chapters 2, 3, 5 and 6 of this book are particularly useful if you do not have
familiarity with git or python.

The provided notebook has the following python dependencies:
